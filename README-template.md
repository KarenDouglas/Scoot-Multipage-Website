## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Remix
- TypeScript
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
 
#### Remix
  First of all, Scoot is my introduction to coding with Remix and a meta-framework in general. Since this is a simple app, I got to dabble in just a few key concepts of Remix. I organized routes with Remix's file-based routing system. 
-  Index Routes 
-  Loading Data
-  Linking StyleSheets
-  Responsive Layout Handling with Vanilla CSS
-  SVG components

#### TypeScript
  After working in TypeScript, the first thing I learned was that I will be using this on every JavaScript heavy project  moving forward. I really appreciated how TypeScript can be leveraged for editing code, too. I experienced how stactic type-checking helps to prevent unnecessary bugs in my code on one hand, and it teaches me how to plan my coding logic better from the start, on the other hand. In addition, I benefited from more specific TypeErrors, making the debugging process smoother.

- Defining Types
- Explisit types
- TypeErrors
- The TypeScript Compiler
- Interface Declaration
- Generics
- TSX

#### HTML
- Details HTML Tag
- Picture & Source Tag

### Continued development

#### Project Planning
  Throughout this challenge, I noticed how many problems would have been solved with thorough project planning. For example, I didn't put a lot of thought into naming conventions for my React components nor  my css classes. As a result, some of my class and components names lack an intuitiveness, which makes it less readable. 
  Not only that, I saw an opportunity to improve how I plan writing stylesheets moving forward. For one, Remix requires developers to make separate stylesheets for different screen sizes(when styling with vanilla css). Looking back on how I styled this project I realize how inefficient my stylsheets were arrange. For instance, I made a stylesheet for each main section of a webpage (navbar, footer, hero section, faq section, careers list section, etc), and for each screen size(desktop, mobile and tablet), instead of creating a stylesheet for each screen-size and adding the appropriate component to each page. 

#### Estimating Build Time
   Estimating how long it would take me to build this project is another area I need to improve on, as I was off by a large margin. I wasn't able to predict how challenging some aspects of building this project would be. Plus I was learning a lot of different things in this one project (Remix, TypeScript more complex CSS) that I didn't predict how this learning curb would effect the timeframe. All in all, I feel certain that my estimations will be more accurate on my next challenge.    

#### TypeScript
  Even though, I learned some TypeScript while building this web app, I know I am barely scratching the surface of this language. On my next project, I will be aiming to get more intuitive with TypeScript.

#### Remix
  It wasn't until I completed my
